    <h2>9/20 - 9/24, Position and responsive web design</h2>

    <div class = "paragraph">
        Our readings this week covered the topics of position and responsive
        web design. Essentially the position property allows us to create
        more complex websites by giving one the ability to make elements' positions
        on the screen stack on top of or be adjacent to one another. This becomes
        useful when creating menus that pop up over the screen or when the screen
        changes sizes elements know how to adjust accordingly. Responsive web design
        is closely related to the concept of element position when designing your
        website. Allowing the screen to adjust according to a users screen size while 
        maintaining a similar experience across all platforms is a big part of designing
        non-hostile websites. Below is an example of font size changing as the screen 
        becomes smaller.

        This week I looked into more ways to edit images, and learned about 
        the clip property in CSS. Essentially it allows you to take an image
        and turn it into any type of shape you want. There are many websites
        that let you design a shape and then give you the necessary CSS to 
        make that shape. This could be used in all sorts of ways from icons to 
        menus to simply background images.
