        <h2>8/25 - 9/3</h2>

        <p>This first week of class we got to learn about 
            a few different interesting topics. Our readings began
            with the history of how the web became to be, and why 
            different data transfer protocols were developed. As well as why certain
            hardware was created in order to make the whole process more
            user friendly. For example routers storing IP addresses and 
            mapping them to domain names.

            Besides the history aspect of the web we also got some hands on experience.
            We got to practice using HTML to construct basic webpages which I had a lot 
            of fun with because I felt like our lab activities allowed us to experiment.
            While doing this we learned how to create forms, tables, display images and videos,
            etc. Below is some sample HTML demonstrating some of the things we learned how
            to do this week. In addition to HTML I watched a few videos on YouTube to learn
            more about CSS styling.

            <h3>Table with CSS border example</h3>

            <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Age</th>
                <th>Avg Wealth</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>20</td>
                <td>16000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>30</td>
                <td>45000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>40</td>
                <td>63000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>50</td>
                <td>117000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>60</td>
                <td>172000</td>
            </tr>
            </table>

            

            <p><img src = "screen1.png" alt = "code example" width = "300" height = "150"> <br>
                Inserting this in the head will give the table its black border.</p>

            
            <br>
            
            <h3>Good practice with adding images example</h3>
            <p><img src = screen2.jpeg alt = "Brody from the movie Jaws"></p>
            <p>Adding images to your page is relatively simply, I could for example
                just add the image above by adding "img src = brody.jpeg" but that 
                wouldn't make the site accessible to those who navigate the web with 
                disabilities. You have to make sure you include alt tags, and if you plan
                on your website becoming popular you should be making it as accessible as 
                possible.
