    <h2>11/15 - 11/19, States</h2>

    <div class = "paragraph">
        
        This week our readings covered everything there was to know about state. 
        What does state mean in the context of the class? In React each component
        current values are known as its state. Components  can rely on the 
        data from another in order for them to respond as a developer wants them to.
        State changes can be slow as they have to travel through the component tree to
        get to different components. This is where Redux comes in to save the day. Redux
        allows you to store states globally, which allows components the ability to access
        them from anywhere.

        While thinking of ideas for my project I thought I might need a slider. I wondered if React
        had a way I could make one (which it does), but while searching for how to do this I started reading 
        about different React libraries. I found one called MUI which has many different components one of them 
        being a slider!
