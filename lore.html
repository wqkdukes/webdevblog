    <p> You may be wondering why the name of this site is squaluslover.me. 
        That is a very good question. Squalus was formerly a genus 
        that every species of shark belonged too. In the modern day this is no longer the case,
        but it was in 1975 when the film <i>Jaws</i> was released. In that movie
        the scientist Hooper refers to the shark as a squalus rather than a shark.
        My friends and I thought that was amusing and since then we've called 
        each other squalus lovers as a joke. <a href = "index.html">Return</a></p>
