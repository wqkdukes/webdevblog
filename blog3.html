    <h2>9/13 - 9/17, Flex Box</h2>

    <p>
        <div class = "paragraph">
        This week we've been discussing Flexbox, which is a layout that allows you to effectively organize items in a container.
        Even when these items have unknown sizes or are dynamic. Some properties included in the flex layout are flex-direction,
        justify-content, and align-items. These properties would typically be used on a flex container to organize its contents.
        For example the CSS below will set the children (the three boxes) to be in a column that is centered in the middle of the
        users screen.
        </div>
        
        <img src = "cssflex.JPG">
        <br>
        <img id = img src = "flexexample.JPG">;

        <br>

        This week I also tried to learn more about how to manipulate images. I found lots of different techniques, but I want to demonstrate the
        one that I thought was the most interesting. CSS has a number of "blend modes". This is a property that you can use to manipulate the colors
        of different items in really cool ways. Below is an image of a handsome man with a number of different blend modes applied, as well as the CSS.
