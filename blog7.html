    <h2>11/1 - 11/5, React</h2>

    <div class = "paragraph">
        This week we began to learn about how to use frameworks to facilitate our creation of dynamic websites.
        These frameworks make it much quicker to develop, style, and do whatever your heart desires! They do this
        by giving you pre-written code for many different routine tasks that you'd normally have to do yourself in 
        JavaScript.

      After learning about React from our readings I wanted to learn more about some of the other frameworks out there.
      The other two most popular ones being Angular and Vue. I was looking for the differences between the three and how
      prevalent they are in the industry. From what I read Angular is the oldest of the three and is supported by Google.
      It's frequently used by enterprise-oriented companies and the government as it seen as a more stable, well-established, 
      and consistent ecosystem. React seems to have the strongest presence on the web, and Vue is the newest kid on the block. 
      Some people's opinion on Vue is that it is a better successor to the original Angular than the present one. Despite all 
      these differences I believe they all have their uses and each have some situation in which they would outperform the other
      two.
