            This week in class we learned how to add style to our barren HTML pages. From black and white 
            pages to much much more. CSS allows you to have much more control over the appearance of your webpages
            in a number of ways. You can sort HTML elements into sections using div which allow you to style different
            areas of the page in different ways. There are many ways to style elements of your page such 
            as borders, sizing, colors, etc.

            To supplement our readings I also watched a few videos going over some helpful tips and modifiers
            for beginners. One video in particular went over blend mode, clipping, and animations. Some of these
            things I thought were only possible using JavaScript, but the more I learn about CSS the more powerful
            I realize it is. Below I have an example of a technique I learned to animated colors on an element. 
            Practically this could be used for when a user hovers over a button or something similar and there 
            could be a subtle shift in color to acknowledge the cursor.

                <div class = "codeimage">
                    <img src = "animation.JPG" alt = "code example" >
                </div>
            <br>
